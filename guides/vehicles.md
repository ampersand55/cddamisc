# Wheelbarrow with pedals

Easy to make.

## Requirements

#### Skills
- none
#### Tools
- 1 tool with bolt turning of 2 or more.
#### #### Components
- Wheelbarrow
- 1 foot crank
#### Resulting vehicle:
```
[handle]
light wheel mount
box (later industrial trash can)
foot pedals
8" wheelbarrow wheel
```

Just install a foot crank on the wheelbarrow. As of this build you can steer it even if the light wheel mount isn't steerable.

Switch the box with an industrial trash can when you can.

Switch 8" the wheelbarrow wheel for a unicycle wheel for slightly better road performance, but worse offroad performance.

# Unicycle trashcan from front-side of a bike

Easy to make.

## Requirements
#### Skills
- Fabrication 1
#### Tools
- 1 tool with bolt turning of 2 or more.
- 1 tool with hammering of 2 or more.
- 1 tool with screw driving of 1 or more.
#### Components
- bicycle or motorcycle
- foot pedals
- 27" bicycle wheel
- industrial trash can

#### Resulting vehicle
```
    [extra light frame]
    -light wheel mount (steerable)
    -industrial trash can
    -foot pedals
    -27" unicycle wheel
```

You need to find any vehicle, such as a bike or motorcycle, with an intact light wheel mount (steerable) mounted on an intact frame. 

The starting vehicle should have these parts:
```
    [any type of frame]
    -light wheel mount (steerable)
```

You'll also need one intact 27" wheel and one foot crank, but it doesn't have to be from the same bike. 

Smash the middle part of the bike and it should separate in two. You only need the front part of the bike. You can make a homewrecker to smash the bike.

First remove the wheel, then reinstall it as a 27" unicycle wheel. Then install a wooden aisle or a collapsible wooden isle on the same tile.

- Fabrication 1 (4 for Wooden wheel mount)
- Mechanics 2
#### Tools
- 1 tool with bolt turning of 2 or more.
- 1 tool with hammering of 2 or more.
#### Components
- 2 x wooden frame
- wooden wheel mount
- foot crank
- 27" bicycle wheel
#### Resulting vehicle
```
    [wooden frame]
    -wooden wheel mount (steerable)
    -industrial trash can
    -foot pedals
    -27" unicycle wheel

# Motorized unicycle trashcan from any vehicle with frame, controls and no enabled security system.

This is a great vehicle you use all the way to the end game. 

### Requirements
#### Skills
- Fabrication 1 (4 for Wooden wheel mount)
- Mechanics 2
#### Tools
1 tool with bolt turning of 2 or more.
- 1 tool with hammering of 2 or more.
- 1 tool with drilling 1 or more.
#### Components
- any vehicle with vehicle controls
- wooden wheel mount 
- jerry can or 60l tank
- small engine
- 27" bicycle wheel
- industrial trash can
#### Resulting vehicle:
```
    [any type of frame]
    -wooden wheel mount (steerable)
    -controls
    -industrial trash can
    -0.05L engine
    -10L vehicle tank
    -27" unicycle wheel
```

For the base vehicle, you need to find any vehicle with intact controls mounted on an intact frame that does not have an intact security system. Smash all tiles next to the tile with controls so that only the tile we want remains.

The starting vehicle should have these parts:
```
    [any type of frame]
    -controls
```

You can get a larger engine, but then you'll need electrical power to start it. For that you need a battery with charges, and preferable also an alternator to recharge the battery. With a 1.6L I4 you can go 3 tiles/turn offroad. 

Resulting vehicle:
```
    [frame]
    -car battery
    -wooden wheel mount (steerable)
    -controls
    -industrial trash can
    -1.6 L I4 engine
    -60L vehicle tank
    -27" unicycle wheel
```

# Upgrades to consider

#### Upgrades you might want to consider for all vehicles:
- cloth roof
- truck horn
- bike rack to turn it into a 2 square vehicle. Either extra storage or a boom crane.
- seat belt or 5 point harness.
- cargo lock

#### Upgrades you might want to consider for vehicles with batteries:
- dashboard for controlling electronics
- headlights or flood light for seeing at night
- stereo for mood bonus
- battery charger
- recharging station
- tool battery mount
- storage battery
- solar panel 

#### Upgrades you might want to consider when you have welding:
- switch the industrial trash can with a cargo space for more storage
- muffler to be quieter
- shock absorber or rebar reinforcement
- steel plating
- drive by wire controls
- turrent mount
- turrent control unit
- mounted weapon
